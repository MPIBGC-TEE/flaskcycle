# Flask Cycle: An R package for tracking air samples in flasks sampled with an automated ICOS flask sampler
The main objective of this package is to provide a set of useful functions to process data related to sampling, storage, and transport of flasks.
It has been developed mostly for the flask cycle at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), but it may be used at other atmospheric stations of the ICOS network.
